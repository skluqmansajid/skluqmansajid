## 🌟 About Me   
I’m a **Computer Science and Engineering student** at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham and a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** who loves building modern, scalable, and user-friendly applications.  
So far, I’ve developed multiple projects such as **AI-powered chatbots, an online currency converter, Telegram bots, and full-stack web apps** using technologies like **React, Node.js, Django, MongoDB, and MySQL**.  
I enjoy taking an idea from scratch and turning it into a live product — focusing on performance, security, and clean user experience. I’m also curious about integrating AI and cloud tools like **Dialogflow, ngrok, and AWS/GCP** into real-world applications.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me learning new frameworks, experimenting with the latest tech trends, or collaborating with peers on innovative projects.
